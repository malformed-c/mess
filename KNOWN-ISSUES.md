# Known issues

## Claude Code sometimes drops an `asyncRewake` delivery entirely

**Symptom:** an idle agent's `mess-wake.sh` correctly parks, receives a peer
message, and fully drains it (confirmed in the daemon log: `recv <agent> woke ->
drained N (peek; left queued)` followed by a non-peek `recv <agent> drained N`,
meaning the script reached its `exit 2` with the message printed to stderr) — but
the message never surfaces in the agent's actual transcript. No injected system
reminder, no `task-notification`, nothing. The agent has no idea a message
arrived until it happens to `mess recv` on its own (or `mess replay` a stale one).

This is **not** the documented working/steer handoff (where an actively busy
agent correctly stands down from waking and lets the mid-turn steer hook notify
instead — see the README's "Getting messages mid-turn" section). It's also not
a race with a concurrent user prompt: reproduced and ruled out below.

### Evidence (2026-07-03)

Agent `dwarf-main` (`/home/engi/git/dwarf`, session
`9902ace8-5f15-4aa8-9645-a48c17ba374e`) was genuinely idle when peer `trail-main`
sent it a direct message:

```
mess daemon log:
12:37:04  (Stop hook fires — dwarf-main goes idle, mess-wake.sh parks)
12:37:09  send trail-main -> dwarf-main | listening=true
12:37:09  recv dwarf-main woke -> drained 1 (peek; left queued)
12:37:10  recv dwarf-main drained 1        <- full, non-peek consume; script
                                               would print to stderr + exit 2
```

dwarf-main's own transcript (`.jsonl`) shows the Stop hook's synchronous summary
at `09:37:04.963Z` (`hookCount: 2`, includes `mess-wake.sh`, `hasOutput: false`
— exactly what's expected for a still-pending async hook). The **next** entry in
the transcript, **106 seconds later**, is an ordinary human-typed prompt
(`origin: human`, `promptSource: typed`) completely unrelated to trail-main.
Nothing in between.

Crucially: Claude Code's internal transcript also logs `{"type":
"queue-operation", "operation": "enqueue"/"dequeue"/...}` entries every time an
async hook's completion is turned into a visible `task-notification` turn. In
this same session, that pattern succeeded **60+ other times**, always as a clean
`enqueue` → `dequeue` pair a few milliseconds apart. For the trail-main wake at
`09:37:09`, there is **no `enqueue` entry anywhere** — the nearest ones are ~2
hours before and ~7 hours after. The background script did its job; Claude Code
never even attempted to turn that into a visible notification.

### Race with a concurrent user prompt — reproduced, but it's a different (correct) behavior

We separately reproduced a real race: sending a peer message to an agent at the
same moment a human types a fresh prompt into that agent's terminal. In that
case the wake script's own `working` check (see `mess-wake.sh`) correctly saw
the agent had just gone busy, stood down, and the mid-turn steer hook surfaced
the message instead — the agent still saw it (via `[mess] N unread...` +
`mess recv`), just through the documented fallback path. No data loss, just a
different, working delivery path. This is *not* what happened to dwarf-main —
there was no human input anywhere near its 106-second gap, and the daemon log
shows the wake script reached full completion (not a stand-down).

### Conclusion

This looks like an intermittent bug in Claude Code's own `asyncRewake` handling
— the harness occasionally fails to enqueue a `task-notification` for a
background hook that exited correctly, with no corresponding error or trace on
the Claude Code side. It's on the harness side, not in `mess`'s own code: the
daemon-level mechanics (idle detection, park, wake, full drain) all worked
exactly as designed.

### Mitigation

This is exactly the scenario `mess replay` exists for — the consumed message is
still recoverable from the per-agent replay buffer even if the harness drops the
injection. If a wake seems to silently not happen for a genuinely idle agent,
`mess replay` before assuming the message is lost. There is currently no way to
detect this failure automatically (the drop leaves no trace on the mess side by
design, since the message actually was delivered/drained from the daemon's point
of view) — it can only be caught after the fact by an operator noticing a peer
never responded.
